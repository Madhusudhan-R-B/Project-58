          <p id="hobby">My favorite hobby is playing chess because it keeps me focused, it is a board game, plus it's really fun!! Some chess games have been played for hours! However you will need patience for playing chess. The player you're versing could take a long time to think of a wise move to try and defeat you. Also you need to know what all the pieces are called, what they do and what the goal of the game is. The most important piece is the king piece. A player has to, not capture him, but put him in a position so that he cannot go into "check". Check means a position when he can be captured! All of this happens with the other player's perspective as well!</p>

          <p id="sport">My favorite sport is cricket because it keeps me fit and it's a fun bat and ball sport!! Some cricket matches have been played for days! However you will need focus for hours and hours for playing cricket. The team you're versing could be skilled just like your team. You also need to know the rules and techniques of batting or bowling and trust me, there are a lot!! If the batsman hit the ball and it bounces before hitting or passing the boundary then it's called a "four" and is worth four points. But if the ball 
          passe the boundary, then it's called a "six" and it's worth, you guessed it, six points! But if the ball is caught directly, then it's an out. The bowler on the other hand will have to try and hit the stumps you're protecting. All of this is happening to the other team as well!</p>
